# Agentic AI: Build Autonomous and Intelligent Agents
**Unleash the power of autonomous decision-making with Agentic AI!**
This repository provides resources, code examples, and potentially frameworks for building intelligent agents capable of perceiving their environment, setting goals, and acting independently to achieve them.

## What you'll find here

* Implementations of agent architectures built with `pydantic-ai`.
* Examples demonstrating how to define agent tools and workflows using `pydantic-ai`'s structured approach.
* Seamless integration with various LLM providers, including:
    * Anthropic (Claude)
    * OpenAI
    * Google (Gemini)
    * Ollama (for local LLM deployment)
* Tools for environment interaction and observation.
* Frameworks for defining goals and reward functions within the `pydantic-ai` ecosystem.
* Case studies and practical applications of agentic AI powered by `pydantic-ai`.
* Tutorials and documentation to get you started with building your own agents.

## Who is this for?

This repository is for developers, researchers, AI enthusiasts, and anyone interested in exploring the field of agentic AI using the `pydantic-ai` library and leveraging the power of different LLM backends.

## Get Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shambhavi-maker/AGENTIC-AI.git]
    cd AGENTIC-AI
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Make sure your `requirements.txt` includes `pydantic-ai` and any necessary client libraries for the LLMs you intend to use (e.g., `anthropic`, `openai`, `google-generativeai`, `ollama`).
3.  **[Optional: Add specific setup instructions based on your project, e.g.,]**
    * Set up API keys or access tokens for your chosen LLM providers.
    * Configure Ollama if you plan to use local models.
    * Run a basic example: `python examples/basic_agent.py` 
4.  **Refer to the [documentation](link) for more detailed instructions and examples on using `pydantic-ai` to build agents with different LLMs.**
